# OneArmedBandit-console-game

The "One-Armed Bandit" game, often referred to as a slot machine, is a popular and iconic gambling device found in casinos and online gaming platforms. Players insert coins or bets, then pull a lever (hence the nickname "one-armed bandit") or press a button to set the reels in motion. The game features multiple spinning reels with various symbols, and the objective is to align matching symbols in a horizontal row, typically called a "payline." When this happens, players are rewarded with credits or cash prizes based on the combination's rarity and predetermined payout rules. "One-Armed Bandit" games come in various themes and styles, offering entertainment and the chance to win money through luck and chance.
